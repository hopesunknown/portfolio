# Jen Tchai - Portfolio Site - (README updated March 2023)

This is a personal portfolio site using React, NextJS, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS where I showcase who I am, my work experiences, skills, projects, social media links. I plan to continue to update this site regularly with Sanity.io, a Content Management System (CMS) software that allows me to easily access and edit content on all the pages.

At the top of the site there are social media buttons (https://jaketrent.github.io/react-social-icons/) that direct user to separate external tab to my GitHub, Medium blog, LinkedIn, and YouTube. It includes a button in the top-right corner to direct user to bottom-most section for contacting me via form submission, powered by Formsubmit.co.

Deployed portfolio site using Vercel, who created NextJS.

## Technologies used:

-React/NextJS (for building user-friendly single-page apps with server-side rendering)
-Typescript (for catching type errors during development)
-Tailwind CSS (for styling and customizable, mobile-first way to to freely build responsive layouts)
-Sanity.io (for backend/CMS - this makes things easy and seamless to update site content from browser)

## Fun extras used:

-Hero Icons (for Contact Me section),
-React Social Icons (for Social Media buttons) - https://jaketrent.github.io/react-social-icons/,
-React Hook Form (for contact form performance/validation),
-Framer Motion (for animations),
-Formsubmit.co (for handling form submissions without exposing my personal email address)

### To start this NextJS project/portfolio site locally:

'cd' into subdirectory called 'jen-portfolio' (this is where the main code lives), type 'npm run dev' in terminal, and then open http://localhost:3000 (this is default) to view it in your browser.
